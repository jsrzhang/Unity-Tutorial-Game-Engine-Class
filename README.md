# Unity-Tutorial-Game-Engine-Class

This is our read me file for our Unity Tutorial: Karting Microgame.

In accordance with the tutorials, we modified the race paths to make a time trial kart game and added purple JumpRamps, Checkpoint Rings, and other props to the scene. Along with the pre-set props like stones, ground, clouds, and trees, the addition of buildings and paths is meant to give the environment a lively and modern feel.
